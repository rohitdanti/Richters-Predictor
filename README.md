# Ritchers-Predictor
A Machine Learning Project completed as part of the Data Mining Course at ASU.

Earthquakes present a significant risk to infrastructure, emphasizing the importance of accurately predicting building damage to support disaster response and recovery efforts. This project investigates the application of machine learning to address this challenge. Using a comprehensive post-disaster dataset from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, which includes detailed building structure and ownership information, the objective is to develop a reliable model for predicting building damage levels. The approach integrates a multi-algorithm ensemble—combining Random Forest, Neural Networks, XGBoost, and Naive Bayes—to capture both linear and non-linear relationships, enhancing model accuracy and robustness.
